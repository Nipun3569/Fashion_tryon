# Title: Fashion_tryon

# 1. Methodology
1. Firstly all the features of the images are extracted from the dataset of fashion product images dataset.
2. After that one image is used to train and test the dataset.
3. A total of five recommendations are generated for that one image.
4. All the images are then trained to generate five recommendations of every image the user uploads.
5. CNN and KNN is applied to extract features and generate recommendations respectively for dataset.
6. Making a try_on feature for the clothing with the help of augmented reality

# 2. Description
A Fahion recommender model is build in which I have applied CNN in order to extract features of clothing apparels. RESNET is used for training the dataset. After appling CNN, KNN is used in order to show 5 most common images reffering to the image uploaded. This completes the fashion recommender model. Adding on to this i have built a try on feature in which you can try the clothing apparel which you like with the help of computer vision as well as augmented reality.

# 3. Algorithms and technology used
# CNN: 
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network, which is a deep learning algorithm used for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically extract relevant features from input images and use them to classify the images into different categories.
# KNN:
KNN stands for k-Nearest Neighbors, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. The algorithm works by finding the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point in the feature space and then assigning the most common class label or the average value of the k-nearest neighbors as the predicted label for the data point
# AR:
Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information, such as images, videos, or 3D models, onto the real world
